# Chrome Web Store Publishing Justifications for Network Investigator

## Permission Justifications

### 1. **activeTab Permission**
**Justification:** "This permission is required to temporarily access the currently active tab when users interact with the extension. Network Investigator needs this to capture network traffic from the active tab and provide real-time analysis of HTTP requests and responses. The permission is only used when the user explicitly opens the DevTools panel."

### 2. **clipboardWrite Permission**
**Justification:** "This permission allows users to copy network request details (cURL commands, JSON responses, headers) to their clipboard for further analysis or testing. Users can right-click on any network call and copy the request as a cURL command for use in terminal or API testing tools."

### 3. **declarativeNetRequest Permission**
**Justification:** "This permission is used to analyze network traffic patterns and provide advanced filtering capabilities. Network Investigator uses this to capture and analyze HTTP requests without intercepting or modifying them, enabling developers to inspect API calls, headers, and response data."

### 4. **host permission use (<all_urls>)**
**Justification:** "Network Investigator needs access to all URLs to capture and analyze network traffic from any website the user visits. This is essential for a network analysis tool that must monitor HTTP requests across different domains and APIs. The extension only reads network data and does not modify any requests."

### 5. **remote code use**
**Justification:** "Network Investigator does not use any remote code. All functionality is contained within the extension package. The extension operates entirely locally within the browser and does not load or execute any code from external sources."

### 6. **scripting Permission**
**Justification:** "This permission is required to inject the DevTools panel script that captures network traffic. Network Investigator uses this to integrate with Chrome's DevTools API and provide the network analysis interface within the browser's developer tools."

### 7. **sidePanel Permission**
**Justification:** "This permission enables Network Investigator to display its interface in Chrome's side panel, providing an alternative way for users to access network analysis features. The side panel shows a simplified view of network calls and filtering options."

### 8. **storage Permission**
**Justification:** "This permission is used to save user preferences, filter configurations, and search settings locally in the browser. Network Investigator stores filter rules, search configurations, and user settings to provide a persistent experience across browser sessions."

### 9. **tabCapture Permission**
**Justification:** "This permission is used for the screenshot feature that allows users to capture the current page state for documentation purposes. Users can take screenshots of web pages while analyzing network traffic to correlate visual changes with API calls."

### 10. **tabs Permission**
**Justification:** "This permission is required to interact with browser tabs for features like page refresh and tab management. Network Investigator uses this to refresh the current page to generate new network traffic for analysis."

### 11. **webRequest Permission**
**Justification:** "This permission is essential for Network Investigator's core functionality. It allows the extension to observe and analyze network traffic in real-time, capturing HTTP requests, responses, headers, and timing information for detailed network analysis."

## Required Descriptions

### 12. **Single Purpose Description**
**Description:** "Network Investigator is a developer tool that provides advanced network traffic analysis capabilities. Its single purpose is to help developers and security professionals inspect, filter, and analyze HTTP/HTTPS requests and responses through an enhanced DevTools interface. The extension captures network traffic, provides real-time filtering and search capabilities, and enables detailed inspection of API calls for debugging and analysis purposes."

### 13. **Data Usage Compliance Certification**
